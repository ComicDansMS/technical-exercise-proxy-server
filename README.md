# Technical Challenge - Proxy Server

## Installation and setup

1. Install node modules with `npm install`
2. Create the `.env` file based on the `.env.example`
  - The default API_KEY of `123456789` in `.env.example` is also included in the API server's `.env.example` for simplicity
3. Run `npm start`

## Usage

- Requests must be sent to the `/api/movies` endpoint along with the required query parameters
